Project title: Predicting heart disease with machine learning

Description:

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical information. The dataset used for this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which is available for download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

The project can be broken down into the following steps:

Data exploration: Explore the dataset by creating visualizations and summary statistics to gain insights into the relationships between the variables.

Data cleaning: Clean the dataset by removing missing or irrelevant data, and convert categorical variables into numerical ones using one-hot encoding.

Feature engineering: Create new features that may be useful for predicting heart disease, such as age, sex, cholesterol level, and blood pressure.

Model training: Train several machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, using a portion of the dataset.

Model evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which one performs best on the test dataset.

Model deployment: Once you have chosen the best-performing model, deploy it in a web application or API where users can input their medical information and receive a predicted likelihood of having heart disease.

This project will teach you essential machine learning skills, such as data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, model selection, and deployment. Additionally, you will have a tangible outcome to showcase to potential employers or clients.\
